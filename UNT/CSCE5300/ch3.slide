* Introduction

* Hypothesis Testing

* Hypothesis Testing

Must define your experiment as a null (H‚ÇÄ) and an alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ or H‚Çê).

H‚ÇÅ is what your are trying to prove.

H‚ÇÄ normally identifies the exact opposite position of H‚ÇÅ.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Statistical significance is given as the _p-value_, and is the probability that H‚ÇÄ is true.

Normally a _p-value_ of 0.05 (5%), is the threshold for rejecting H‚ÇÄ and accepting H‚ÇÅ.

* Hypothesis Testing - Type I and II errors

- Type I error [Œ±] -> incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ).

- Type II error [Œ≤] -> failure to reject a false null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ).

* Hypothesis Testing - Power and Sample size

_Power_ of a test is the probability that the test correctly rejects H‚ÇÄ when H‚ÇÅ is actually true.

Given as 1 - Œ≤.

_Power_ increases with sample size, so it can be used to determine the necessary sample size.

* Hypothesis Testing - Contingency tables

* Student's t-test

The _t-test_ is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's _t-distribution_ under H‚ÇÄ.

* Resampled Paired Student's t-test

Over several trials, a sample _S_ is randomly divided into a training set _R_ of a certain size (for example 2/3rds of the data) and a test set _T_.

Classifiers _A_ and _B_ are trained on _R_ and then tested against _T_.

_t_ is computed as follows:

.caption p·∂¶ is the differences of the proportion of errors rates between _A_ and _B_

Error rates of _A_ and _B_ are not independent since the test sets in the trials overlap, as well as the training sets.

* k-fold cross-validated paired t-test

Identical to resampled _t-test_ except that instead of randomly dividing _S_:

1. _S_ is divided into _k_ disjoint sets _T_ of equal size.

2. _k_ trials are conducted, and the test set for each trial is _T·µ¢_ whereas the training set is the union of all other _T‚±º_, _j_‚â†_i_.

3. The same _t_ statistic is computed as before.

Not useful for big data applications, only when a same sample size is available, due to the amount of variation between each trial is minimal.

* Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test

While the _t-test_ is parametric, i.e. it assumes sample distributions, the Wilcoxon test is nonparametric.

Normally used as an alternative when the population cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.

* Proportional Error Rate Test

Simple test measuring the difference between error rates of classifier A and classifier B.

* McNemar's Test

- Uses a contingency table for input values.
- Based on ùõò¬≤ test for goodness-of-fit that compares the distribution of counts expected under H‚ÇÄ to observed counts.
- Useful for detecting Type I errors.

* Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

Useful for testing the difference between multiple (more than two) groups.

Conceptually similar to multiple two-sample _t-tests_, but results in less Type I errors

Each population is assumed to be normally distributed.

H‚ÇÄ defined as all population means are equal, where H‚ÇÅ is that at least one pair of the populations means are not equal.

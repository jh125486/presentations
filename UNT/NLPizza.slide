* Introduction

* Introduction

Our goal is to make ordering Pizza easier for the end user.
We achieved this goal by:

- Minimizing physical and mental *interaction* with the application
- *Streamlining* the actual order process (extraneous options and prompts removed)
- *Minimalist* user interface for a direct user experience

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)

A branch of Artificial Intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. - _Wikipedia_

- Work began in the 1950's (with exceedingly optimistic future expectations)
- Used hand-written rules until the 1980's
- Current work uses Deep Learning (recurrent) neural networks (~biological brain)

*Speech*Recognition*: Given a sound clip of speech, extract the textual representation.

- *Amazon*: _Alexa_, *Alexa*Skills*Kit* (SDK)
- *Apple*: _Siri_, *Speech.framework* (iOS)
- *Google*: _Google_Voice_, _Google_Now_, _Google_Assistant_, *SpeechRecognizer* (Android)
- *Microsoft*: _Cortana_, *Microsoft*Speech*Platform* (Windows)

* Architecture

* Overview

: Audio/visual prompt for input (highlighted, speech synthesized)
: Input (speech)
: Process (NLP => created pizza order)
: Finalize order (Dominoes REST gateway "hack")

* Initial work

* Accessibility in mind

- Focused on back and forth prompts with feedback.
- Scripted way to guide a user down the pizza ordering process.
- Branching ordering flow, e.g. multiple ways to order/edit a pizza.

* Prototype (1)

* Prototype (2)

* Problems

*☹* SDK failed us.

- Could only fire off one prompt with speech synthesizer.
- Hooking into Speech Recognizer with callbacks was painful.
- Automatically stopping recording was problematic (normal speech pauses during ordering interfered with RMS)

Other _fun_ issues:

- Cannot test speech recognition on simulator, only a hard device
- Swift cannot pass by reference, so many _local_ variables were promoted to _global_
- Threading back and forth between UI thread (main) and background threads

* Usability testing

* Pretty Charts

.caption Results for sample questions during usability testing conducted April 20th-25th 2017.

* The Good

- Responsive (app picked up all orders correctly)
- Easy to use (no learning curve)
- Ordering flow was direct (no branching)

* The Bad

- Color palette used (background/text)
- Iconic feedback (specifically for options available)
- No help for available sizes or toppings (feature _was_ hotfixed in)

* The Ugly

- Order invoice is not spoken back to user (state failure)
- Cannot edit an order (only cancel to exit)
- Third-party app, so actual ordering is non-optimal (_cough_ "hack" _cough_)

* Final Product

* Final Product

0.  Uses only one prompt, with a _looser_ format, textual shown to the user.
1.  Immediately starts prompting user on application load.
2.  After prompt, starts recording speech without user interaction (_no_tap_).
3.  User stops recording (_1st_tap_), speech is processed and order struct populated.
4a. Invoice displayed for order.
4b. User is presented with two options, cancel or proceed (_2nd_tap_).

NLPed order features:

- Multiple pizzas in one order
- Zero or more toppings for each pizza
- Each pizza topping can be "regular" or "extra" (+price modifier)

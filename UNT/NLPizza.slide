* Introduction

* Introduction

Our goal is to make ordering Pizza easier for the end user.
We achieved this goal by:

- Minimizing physical and mental *interaction* with the application
- *Streamlining* the actual order process (extraneous options and prompts removed)
- *Minimalist* user interface for a direct user experience

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)

A branch of Artificial Intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. - _Wikipedia_

- Work began in the 1950's (with exceedingly optimistic future expectations)
- Used hand-written rules until the 1980's
- Current work uses Deep Learning neural networks (akin to biological brain)

Speech Recognition: Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.

* Architecture

* Architecture

Application consists of three parts:

- User prompt (speech synthesizer)
- NLP of input to a pizza order
- Integration with Dominoes Pizza REST gateway

* Initial work

* Initial work

Focused on back and forth prompts with feedback.
Scripted way to guide a user down the pizza ordering process.
Branching ordering flow, e.g. multiple ways to order/edit a pizza.

*â˜¹* SDK failed us.

- Could only fire off one prompt with speech synthesizer.
- Swift cannot pass by reference, so many _local_ variables were promoted to _global_
- Hooking into Speech Recognizer with callbacks was painful.

* Usability testing

* The Good

- Responsive (app picked up all orders correctly)
- Easy to use (no learning curve)
- Ordering flow was direct (no branching)

?? Charts ??

* The Bad

- Colors used
- Iconic feedback (specifically for options available)
- E

* The Ugly

- stuff1
- stuff2
- stuff3

* Final Product

* Final Product

Uses only one prompt, with a _looser_ format given to the user.

- Multiple pizzas in one order
- None/single/multiple toppings for each pizza
- Each topping can be "regular" or "extra"

Feedback is given in the invoice after the order has been parsed/interpreted.

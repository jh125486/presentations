* Iota

- used in *const* to simplify definitions of incrementing numbers
- values of iota is reset to 0 whenever the reserved word const appears
- increments by one after each line

- Ref: [[https://splice.com/blog/iota-elegant-constants-golang/]]

* Iota ...

    type ByteSize float64

    const (
        _           = iota // ignore first value by assigning to blank identifier
        KB ByteSize = 1 << (10 * iota)
        MB
        GB
        TB
        PB
        EB
        ZB
        YB
    )

* Iota ...

    // Token represents a lexical token.
    type Token int

    const (
        // Illegal represents an illegal/invalid character
        Illegal Token = iota

        // Whitespace represents a white space (" ", \t, \r, \n) character
        Whitespace

        // EOF represents end of file
        EOF

        // MarkerID represents '\id' or '\id1' marker
        MarkerID

        // MarkerIde represents '\ide' marker
        MarkerIde

* Variadic functions

- can be called with any number of arguments
- fmt.Println is a common variadic function
- can be called with individual arguments
- multiple args in a slice can be passed like this

    func(slice... )

* Variadic functions ...

.play code/function1.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Embedding

* Logging

* Files

* Defer, Panic, and Recover

- Yet another mechanism for control flow
- A _panic_ causes the program stack to begin unwinding and _recover_ can stop it
- Deferred functions are still executed as the stack unwinds
- If _recover_ is called inside such a deferred function, the stack stops unwinding
- The _recover_ returns the value (as an _interface{}_) that was passed to panic
- A _panic_ cannot be recovered by a different goroutine

- [[https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/PanicAndRecover]]

* Defer, Panic, and Recover ...

.play code/panic1.go /START MAIN OMIT/,/END MAIN OMIT/

* Defer, Panic, and Recover ...

.play code/panic1.go /START HELPERS OMIT/,/END HELPERS OMIT/

* Defer, Panic, and Recover ...

.play code/panic1.go /START PARSE OMIT/,/END PARSE OMIT/

* Defer, Panic, and Recover ...

.play code/panic1.go /START FIELDS2NUMBERS OMIT/,/END FIELDS2NUMBERS OMIT/

* JSON

* Hello HTTP

.play code/hellohttp.go

* go vet

- Checks for code correctness, beyond what is necessary to compile the code

* Golint

Installation:

    go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint

Usage:

- Invoke _golint_ with one or more filenames, a directory, or a package named by its import path.
- Golint uses the same import path syntax as the _go_ command
- supports relative import paths like ./...

* Godoc

- Document exported variables, constants, functions etc.
- Documents are regular comments just above the declarations
- No blank between comment and declarations

    // Package geometry provides methods to calculate area, perimeter etc.
    package geometry

    // Geometry interface type define methods required for any shape/geometry
    type Geometry interface {
        Area() float64
        Perimeter() float64
    }

    // Pi represents an aproximate value of Pi
    const Pi = 3.14

* Godoc ...

- To see documentation for a package:

    godoc fmt

- To see documentation for a particular fuction in a package:

    godoc fmt Sscanf

- Online documentaion: [[https://godoc.org][https://godoc.org]]

* Testing

- Tests are distinguished by file name
- Test file names end with *_test.go*

* Vim configuration

.code code/vimrc

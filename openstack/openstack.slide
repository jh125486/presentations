* Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

Definition (per _IETF_):

- Abstracted
- Self-service (_on-demand_)
- Utility-based billing

* Cloud computing

* Prehistory

- Mainframes
- Servers
- Rise of the Internet
- Virtualization Revolution
- The Cloud

.caption Evolution of _Computing_

* History

- July 2010: Rackspace & NASA started initial project
- Oct 2010: *Austin* OpenStack preview released
- End 2011: CERN starts building their private cloud (currently over 150k cores)
- 2012: OpenStack Foundation established
- 2016: AT&T virtualized over 1/3 of their network using OpenStack
- 2017: *Ocata* released

*Future*:

- Software-defined networking (SDN) plugins
- Network functions virtualization (NFV)


* Organization
- Open-sourced, driven by non-profit foundation
- 6-month release cycle after each conference
- Releases are codenamed after a landmark at the conference that begins with the next letter in the alphabet
- "Big Tent" model, where OpenStack projects can be developed in an Agile manner

* Architecture

- Completely modular, dependent on _Linux_
- Almost all components written in _Python_
- Multi-vendor backends for components (hypervisors/storage/authentication/etc.)

* API/SDKs
OpenStack provides four different options for interacting with its APIs from _Python_:

- [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openstacksdk][OpenStack SDK]]
- _Python_ library [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/shade][shade]]
- Per-project client libraries
- Direct REST calls via keystoneauth

APIs for other languages:

- _Go_: [[https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud][gophercloud (by Rackspace)]]
- _Ruby_: [[https://github.com/ruby-openstack/ruby-openstack][OpenStack Official]]
